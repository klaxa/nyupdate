Tracks RSS-Feeds from nyaa.se and adds new torrents to a program of your choice.

With my (klaxa's) additions this software requries libtorrent with python3
bindings additionally to feedparser.
Status e-mails can be sent optionally, just enable it in the code (maybe add a
command line switch for that?). The configuration for sending e-mails should be
pretty straight forward. As of now it only works with google mail accounts.
